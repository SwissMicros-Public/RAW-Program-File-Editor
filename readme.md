# RAW Program File Editor 

This repository contains a **RAW Program File Editor** for the DM42/Free42.

The editor is written in JavaScript and runs locally and offline in any browser.

After uploading a raw file from local storage, it gets decoded and displayed as source code in a text area ready for editing.

The tool encodes to save the source code as a raw file.
